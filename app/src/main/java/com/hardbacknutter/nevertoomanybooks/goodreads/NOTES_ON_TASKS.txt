1. task-queue - minimalistic traditional database backed 'MessageQueue' like product
   Task
   LegacyTask extends Task
   RunnableTask extends Task
   GenericTask extends RunnableTask

Only used by the GoodReads api where it does make sense to have 'survivable' tasks.
Hardcoded defaults clean up dead tasks after 7 days.

WorkManager sounds like a good replacement.
