TODO: performance tuning.
 * image caching from main preferences.
 * book extra details task/immediate from style. Default on ? (but need to fix 'bookshelves')
 * find some rule to switch task/immediate automatically depending on number of books ?

TODO: usage "profile": comics versus fiction books versus non-fiction books.
 * optimize all search engines
 * optimize visible fields.
 * optimize maybe different author types.

TODO: New anthology stuff:
 * when to delete entries in ANTHOLOGY ? when last book is gone? or keep them for adding
   to new books / wish list?
 * consider a purge based on book for orphan TocEntry (a purge based on Author is already done)

TODO: Review database stuff
 * Very few database methods throw an SQLiteDoneException.
 * The caller is either already catching them, or believes they will never happen.
 *
 * database insert methods which return -1 for failing to insert. Not all callers check.
 * catch NotFoundException (or not?)
 * bind variables versus string concat
 * could global replace of author/series be optimized ? For now it's cumbersome and long-winded.
 * move Publisher, Location, Format ... to separate tables ?

ENHANCE: database using 'lower()' in WHERE and ORDER BY clauses.
 * check indexes for using all lower case, then eliminate the lower() for all that uses
   those indexes.
 * 'order by' columns have been added to TITLE (book, series, tocEntry) and AUTHOR name fields.

ENHANCE: XML Exporter / Importer
 * pro: easier / (sort of) foolproof / FLEXIBLE!
 * con: fools / fields will be bigger due to labels/tags
        not easy to get 'others' to create import files
        importing IDs is dangerous

ENHANCE: currency fields should not use float/double.
https://javamoney.github.io - a wonderful library, although it seems it
won't make it into the JDK for now. Might have issues on Android though.
https://www.joda.org/joda-money/ not tried, but looks small and neat.
Alternatively migrate to using BigDecimal as a short term solution.

TODO: go over ViewModel usage and related onSaveInstanceState. Remove the latter when appropriate.

==> SearchCoordinator.search when isbn not provided, will run a search until it finds an isbn,
    and then redo the search WITH the isbn
==> so this is why we only ever get ONE result back.
