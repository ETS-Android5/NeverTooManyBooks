Supported Android versions:

* v1.1.2 runs on Android 6.0 (API 23)

* v1.2.0 requires Android 7.0 (API 24)
Recent code changes using classes from the "coreLibraryDesugaring" functionality,
and "minSdkVersion 23" led to startup crashes on devices with API 23.
The same configuration works fine on devices with API 24.
The reason seems related to https://developer.android.com/studio/build/multidex.html
Not fixing.

ENHANCE: usage "profile": comics versus fiction books versus non-fiction books.
 * optimize all search engines
 * optimize visible fields.
 * show/hide only certain author types.

TODO: move Location, Format ... to separate tables ?

ENHANCE: image url loading... keep DIY, or move to Glide (v4.10.0 is using androidx)

TODO: task-queue - minimalistic traditional database backed 'MessageQueue' like product
    Only used by the GoodReads api where it does make sense to have 'survivable' tasks.
    Hardcoded defaults clean up dead tasks after 7 days.
    WorkManager sounds like a good replacement.

==> SearchCoordinator.search when isbn not provided, will run a search until it finds an isbn,
    and then redo the search WITH the isbn
==> so this is why we only ever get ONE result back.
