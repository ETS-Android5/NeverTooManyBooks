WorldCat permits searching its catalog by ISSN, by entering "issn:"+ISSN code in the query field.
One can also go directly to an ISSN's record by appending it to "https://www.worldcat.org/ISSN/",
 e.g. https://www.worldcat.org/ISSN/1021-9749. This does not query the ISSN Register itself,
  but rather shows whether any Worldcat library holds an item with the given ISSN.
