        Copy of "material:abc_alert_dialog_button_bar_height" which is used as minHeight for a button.
        This is a work around for what seems to be a bug where the buttons end up with a 0-height
        when their height is set to WRAP_CONTENT.
        Instead we set the button height to this value.
