Small notes in addition:

* trimming
  Wherever a View is READ as a String, a trim should be done
       view.getText().toString().trim();

  Fields

  getSharedPreferences strings
  not checked yet.

  The database (as of v82) will/can contain untrimmed strings.
  Best to add .trim() to al locations where a getString is done.
  Eventually the database will then be trim-proof.
  TODO: perhaps run a batch correction on all fields as an update ? bit brutal...

  No doubt some places do a trim which is not really needed, something for a rainy day.

* Layout in code:
    * Use a ViewGroup instead of f.e. LinearLayout where possible.
      This leaves the layout flexible to choose a different type without code changes

* checkable Buttons:
    * CheckBox, RadioButton, Switch, ToggleButton extend CompoundButton, implements Checkable
    * CheckedTextView extends TextView, implements Checkable

    Use 'CompoundButton' and/or 'Checkable' where possible.
    This leaves the layout flexible to choose a different type without code changes

* Instead of simply letting NullPointersException happen (and/or using a lint 'suppress'),
  check it explicitly there *has* to be 'data':
                    Objects.requireNonNull(data);
   Main reason is a reminder to the developer that if it was null it's *their* fault.
   But, nothing wrong with this:
       if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK && data != null && data.hasExtra(UniqueId.BKEY_AUTHOR_ARRAY)) {

   System stuff + not finding R.id fields in layout... just use lint suppress, will all show on first test run anyhow

* pedantic but I hope polite request:
  Single character variables names are best left to BASIC style from the 1980's

* TODO tags used
  - TODO
  - FIXME
  - ENHANCE
  - TEST: work done, but needs proper testing
  - RELEASE : things that must be checked before doing a public release
  - NEWKIND : where a list of 'items' is processed -> where you can/should add 'items' to that list
