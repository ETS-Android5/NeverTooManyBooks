Original guidelines for the project:

Small notes in addition:

* trimming
  Wherever a View is READ as a String, a trim should be done
       view.getText().toString().trim();

  Fields
  2018-10-01 ok

  getSharedPreferences string
  not checked yet.

  The database (as of v82) will/can contain untrimmed strings.
  Best to add .trim() to al locations where a getString is done.
  Eventually the database will then be trim-proof.
  TODO: perhaps run a batch correction on all fields as an update ? bit brutal...

  No doubt some places do a trim which is not really needed, something for a rainy day.


* pedantic but I hope polite request:
  Single character variables names are best left to BASIC style from the 1980's

* TODO tags used
  - TODO
  - FIXME
  - ENHANCE
  - RELEASE : things that must be checked before doing a public release
  - NEWKIND : where a list of 'items' is processed -> where you can/should add 'items' to that list
