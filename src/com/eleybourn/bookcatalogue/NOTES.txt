TOMF ENHANCE New anthology stuff:
 * to think about:
 * - when to delete entries in ANTHOLOGY ? when last book is gone or keep them, for adding to new books / wish list
 * - consider a purge based on book for orphan TOCEntry (a purge based on Author is already done)

TOMF FIXME database stuff
 * FIXME: Very few database methods throw an SQLiteDoneException.
 * The caller is either already catching them, or believes they will never happen.
 *
 * FIXME: database insert methods which return -1 for failing to insert. Not all callers check.
 * FIXME: catch UpdateException (or not?)
 * FIXME: catch NotFoundException (or not?)
 * bind variables versus string concat

TOMF ENHANCE database using 'lower()' in WHERE and ORDER BY clauses. Performance? Better 'Collation' setting?'.
  * check indexes for all lower case, then eliminate the lower() for all that uses those indexes.
  * force table creation to use NOCASE ? but what about current LOCALIZED then ?

ENHANCE finish FTS searching {@link com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue.searches.SearchLocalActivity}
 * and {@link #searchFts(String, String, String)}

TOMF: research 'local' search. The code has some stuff enabled, but not tested. -> check BC 5.2.2 release (not master)

ENHANCE instead of string encoding of lists, use JSON ? or at the very least ArrayList<String>
 * pro: easier / (sort of) foolproof / FLEXIBLE!
 * con: fools / fields will be bigger due to json labels
 * => or... do a specific JSON Exporter / Importer as an alternative to the Csv model (con: not easy to get 'others' to provide import files)

TOMF Parcelable ?  see FileChooserFragment example use

TODO: onCreate exception catching or not
-> let it be thrown ?
-> catch, log ?
-> catch, log, re-throw ?

TODO: dialogs/* -> eliminate the pass up of the actual dialog. -> dismiss earlier
