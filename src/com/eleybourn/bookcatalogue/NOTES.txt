Coding reminder:
When using onCreateView for a DialogFragment with dynamic added content,
onResume should force the enclosing dialog to be big enough:
        Dialog dialog = getDialog();
        if (dialog != null) {
            int width = ViewGroup.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT;
            int height = ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT; // MATCH_PARENT
            dialog.getWindow().setLayout(width, height);
        }

TODO: New anthology stuff:
 * to think about:
 * - when to delete entries in ANTHOLOGY ? when last book is gone? or keep them for adding to new books / wish list?
 * - consider a purge based on book for orphan TocEntry (a purge based on Author is already done)

TODO: Review database stuff
 * - Very few database methods throw an SQLiteDoneException.
 * The caller is either already catching them, or believes they will never happen.
 *
 * - database insert methods which return -1 for failing to insert. Not all callers check.
 * - catch NotFoundException (or not?)
 * - bind variables versus string concat
 * could global replace of author/series be optimized ? For now it's cumbersome and long-winded.

ENHANCE: database using 'lower()' in WHERE and ORDER BY clauses.
 * Performance? Better 'Collation' setting?'. LIKE operator ?
 * check indexes for using all lower case, then eliminate the lower() for all that uses those indexes.
 * force table creation to use NOCASE ? but what about current LOCALIZED then ?

ENHANCE: move Publisher, Location, Format ... to separate tables ?

ENHANCE: XML Exporter / Importer
 * pro: easier / (sort of) foolproof / FLEXIBLE!
 * con: fools / fields will be bigger due to labels/tags
        not easy to get 'others' to create import files
        importing id's is dangerous

TODO: remove the Apache http client; it's removed from API: 23. Seems to be a requirement for Signpost?
Signpost claims that the native android HttpURLConnection is buggy... and suggest to always use apache on android

==> SearchManager.search when isbn not provided, will run a search until it finds an isbn, and then redo the search WITH the isbn
==> so this is why we only ever get ONE result back.
