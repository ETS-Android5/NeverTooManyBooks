TOMF ENHANCE New anthology stuff:
 * to think about:
 * - when to delete entries in ANTHOLOGY ? when last book is gone or keep them, for adding to new books / wish list
 * - consider a purge based on book for orphan TOCEntry (a purge based on Author is already done)

TOMF FIXME database stuff
 * FIXME: Very few database methods throw an SQLiteDoneException.
 * The caller is either already catching them, or believes they will never happen.
 *
 * FIXME: database insert methods which return -1 for failing to insert. Not all callers check.
 * FIXME: catch UpdateException (or not?)
 * FIXME: catch NotFoundException (or not?)
 * bind variables versus string concat

TOMF ENHANCE database using 'Upper()' when sorting (performance?). Replace by an extra table column with the value pre-upper'd? Uppercase Index ?
  * pro: sorting faster
  * con: more space

ENHANCE finish FTS searching {@link com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue.searches.SearchLocalActivity}
 * and {@link #searchFts(String, String, String)}
 * - what is android 'local' search ? ->research

ENHANCE instead of string encoding of lists, use JSON ? or at the very least ArrayList<String>
 * pro: easier / (sort of) foolproof / FLEXIBLE!
 * con: fools / fields will be bigger due to json labels
 * => or... do a specific JSON Exporter / Importer as an alternative to the Csv model (con: not easy to get 'others' to provide import files)

TOMF ENHANCE: should Activities all become Fragments ? Or whatever is new ?

TOMF Parcelable ?  see FileChooserFragment example use

TODO: onCreate exception catching or not
-> let it be thrown ?
-> catch, log ?
-> catch, log, re-throw ?

TODO: dialogs/* -> eliminate the pass up of the actual dialog. -> dismiss earlier
