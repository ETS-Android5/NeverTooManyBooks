TOMF ENHANCE: New anthology stuff:
 * to think about:
 * - when to delete entries in ANTHOLOGY ? when last book is gone or keep them, for adding to new books / wish list
 * - consider a purge based on book for orphan TOCEntry (a purge based on Author is already done)

Review database stuff
 * - Very few database methods throw an SQLiteDoneException.
 * The caller is either already catching them, or believes they will never happen.
 *
 * - database insert methods which return -1 for failing to insert. Not all callers check.
 * - catch UpdateException (or not?)
 * - catch NotFoundException (or not?)
 * - bind variables versus string concat

ENHANCE: database using 'lower()' in WHERE and ORDER BY clauses.
 * Performance? Better 'Collation' setting?'. LIKE operator ?
 * check indexes for using all lower case, then eliminate the lower() for all that uses those indexes.
 * force table creation to use NOCASE ? but what about current LOCALIZED then ?

ENHANCE: finish FTS searching {@link com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue.searches.AdvancedLocalSearchActivity}
 * and {@link #searchFts(String, String, String)}

TOMF: research 'local' search. The code has some stuff enabled, but not tested. -> check BC 5.2.2 release (not master)

ENHANCE: instead of string encoding of lists, at the very least use ArrayList<String>;
only do the multi-string encoding/decoding at CSV level

ENHANCE: XML Exporter / Importer
 * pro: easier / (sort of) foolproof / FLEXIBLE!
 * con: fools / fields will be bigger due to labels/tags / not easy to get 'others' to create import files

TODO: remove the Apache http client; it's removed from API: 23.

ENHANCE: https://github.com/eleybourn/Book-Catalogue/issues/723 - add book by search: allow publisher + present list of finds instead of using first found.
==> SearchManager.search when isbn not provided, will run a search until it finds an isbn, and then redo the search WITH the isbn
==> so this is why we only ever get ONE result back.
