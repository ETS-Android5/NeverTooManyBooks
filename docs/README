This is an open source Android application. Please feel free to fork, bug fix
and commit back.

This is a simple book catalogue application, to store a list of your books.
Books can be added either manually, by ISBN, or by barcode.

Requires minimal Android 7.0 (API 24)

In August 2018, this project was forked from:
Book Catalogue 5.2.2 @2016 Philip Warner & Evan Leybourn
Without their original creation, this project would not exist in its
current form. It was however largely rewritten/refactored and any
comments on this fork should be directed at HardBackNutter and not
at the original creators.
